## üõ°Ô∏è Price Objection Handling

### **"It's too expensive"**

- Our solution: ‚Ç¨2,000/month
- You're not paying ‚Ç¨2,000, you're SAVING ‚Ç¨33,000

- 1 month delay = ‚Ç¨33,000 in continued waste
- Setup takes 2 weeks, so you're looking at 6 weeks of losses
- That's ‚Ç¨49,500 in cost while you 'think about it'
- The thinking cost is 25x our entire first year fee"

### **"We don't have budget"**
**Response:** "You already have the budget - it's currently being spent on inefficient manual processes. We're not asking for NEW budget, we're asking to REDIRECT existing waste into a productive solution."

### **"Can you do it for less?"**

- 30-day free trial to prove value first
