## 📖 Essential RAG Patterns (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **Pattern 1: Basic RAG Pipeline (50 lines)**
```python
# You'll implement this 3 times across projects
def basic_rag_pipeline(documents, query):
    # 1. Chunk documents
    chunks = chunk_documents(documents)
    
    # 2. Generate embeddings
    embeddings = embed_chunks(chunks)
    
    # 3. Store in vector DB
    store_vectors(embeddings)
    
    # 4. Retrieve relevant chunks
    relevant = retrieve(query)
    
    # 5. Generate response
    return generate_answer(query, relevant)
```

### **Pattern 2: French Optimization**
```python
# Reuse across all projects
def optimize_for_french(text):
    # Handle French special characters
    # Preserve legal/medical terms
    # Optimize chunk boundaries
    return processed_text
```

### **Pattern 3: Production Deployment**
```python
# Same pattern for all 3 projects
def deploy_rag_system():
    # Error handling
    # Caching layer
    # Monitoring
    # Multi-tenant support
    return production_system
```
